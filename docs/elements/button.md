Buttons allow an application to communicate action and direct user intent.

# Primary
A primary color provides consistency across an application. It trains the user to look for that color when trying to find an action.

```html
<button class="button">
    Hello world
</button>
```
## Disabled

```html
<button class="button" disabled>
    Hello world
</button>
```
# Secondary
For secondary actions on each page. Secondary buttons can only be used in conjunction with a primary button.

As part of a pair, the secondary button’s function is to perform the negative action of the set, such as “Cancel” or “Back”.

```html
<button class="button is-secondary">
    Hello world
</button>
```

## Disabled

```html
<button class="button is-secondary" disabled>
    Hello world
</button>
```
