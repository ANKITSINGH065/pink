Search offers users a way to explore using keywords. Search can be used as the primary means of discovering content, or as a filter to aid the user in finding content.

```html
<div class="input-text-wrapper">
  <input type="search" placeholder="Search" />
  <div class="icon-search" aria-hidden="true"></div>
</div>
```
