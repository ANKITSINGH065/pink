| Class    | Type   |                               |

  <div class="u-flex u-gap-16 u-main-center u-cross-center">
    <input type="checkbox" class="switch" />
    <input type="checkbox" class="switch" checked />
  </div>
</Preview>

## States

To disable a switch, add the following class:

| Attribute  | Type     |                                                  |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `disabled` | Disabled | Use whenever clicking on a switch isn't allowed. |

<Preview center>
  <div class="u-flex u-gap-16 u-main-center u-cross-center">
    <input type="checkbox" class="switch" disabled />
    <input type="checkbox" class="switch" checked disabled />
  </div>
</Preview>

## Sizes

There are three sizes of selectors; small, medium and large. Each size has its own purpose, so make sure you use every size correctly.

| class      | Type   |     |
| ---------- | ------ | --- |
| `is-small` | Small  |     |
| -          | Medium |     |
| `is-large` | Large  |     |

<Preview center>
  <div class="u-flex u-gap-16 u-main-center u-cross-center">
    <input type="checkbox" class="switch is-small" />
    <input type="checkbox" class="switch" checked />
    <input type="checkbox" class="switch is-large" />
  </div>
</Preview>

## Usage

We recommend switches next to labels should have at minimum 8px of space in between for legibility. Switches should be aligned to the center of a single line of text. If there are multiple lines in a label should be aligned to the center of the first line in the label.

<br />

Switches refer to a single item and allow turning an item on or off.
