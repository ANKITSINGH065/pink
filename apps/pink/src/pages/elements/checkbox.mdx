### Sizes

There are three sizes of selectors; large, medium and small. Each size has its own purpose, so make sure you use every size correctly.

| ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `is-small` | Small  |             |

| `is-large` | Large  |             |

<Preview center>
  <div class="u-flex u-flex-vertical u-gap-16 ">
    <div class="u-flex u-gap-16 u-main-center u-cross-center">
      <input type="checkbox" class="is-small" />
      <input type="checkbox" checked />
      <input type="checkbox" class="is-large" />
    </div>
  </div>
</Preview>

## Usage

We recommend choice selectors next to labels should have at minimum 8px of space in between for legibility. Choice selectors should be aligned to the center of a single line of text. If there are multiple lines in a label should be aligned to the center of the first line in the label.

Checkboxes allow users to select multiple items from a set.
