## States

To disable a checkbox, add the following class:

| Attribute  | Type     |                                                    |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `disabled` | Disabled | Use whenever clicking on a checkbox isn't allowed. |

<Preview center>
  <input type="checkbox" disabled /> <input type="checkbox" checked disabled />
</Preview>

## Sizes

There are three sizes of checkboxes; small, medium and large. Each size has its own purpose, so make sure you use every size correctly.

| class      | Type   |             |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `is-small` | Small  |             |
| -          | Medium |             |
| `is-large` | Large  |             |

<Preview center>
  <div class="u-flex u-flex-vertical u-gap-16 ">
    <div class="u-flex u-gap-16 u-main-center u-cross-center">
      <input type="checkbox" class="is-small" />
      <input type="checkbox" checked />
      <input type="checkbox" class="is-large" />
    </div>
  </div>
</Preview>

## Usage

We recommend checkboxes next to labels should have at minimum 8px of space in between for legibility. Checkboxes should be aligned to the center of a single line of text. If there are multiple lines in a label should be aligned to the center of the first line in the label.

<br />

Checkboxes allow users to select multiple items from a set.

:::DO
Use checkboxes to allow users select one or more options from a list with related items.
:::
:::DONT
Do not use switches, they don't imply the items are related, and take up more visual space.
