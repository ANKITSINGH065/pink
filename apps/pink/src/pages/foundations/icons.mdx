## General Icons

In Appwrite we use the [heroicons](https://v1.heroicons.com/) library. By following the steps below, you can easily include all icons in your projects:

<ol class="numeric-list u-margin-block-start-24">
  <li class="numeric-list-item">
    <div class="u-flex u-flex-vertical u-gap-8">
      <p class="u-bold">Navigate to Heroicons website</p>
      <p>Navigate to [heroicons](https://v1.heroicons.com/) and make sure you are looking at the solid icons. Select an icon and copy its name.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
    <li class="numeric-list-item">
    <div class="u-flex u-flex-vertical u-gap-8">
      <p class="u-bold">Use the selected icon</p>
      <p>In your code use a class, type `icon-` and paste the iconâ€™s name right after.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

## Additional Icons
Social and technology icons are available in gray-scale and color. Gray-scale Icons were translated into class names and color icons are available as SVG files.

## Best Practice

We recommend using at minimum 4px of space between icons and labels for
legibility. Icons should be aligned to the center of a single line of text. If
there are multiple lines in a label, the icon should be aligned to the center
of the first line in the label.
