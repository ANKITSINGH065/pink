## General Icons

In Appwrite we use the [heroicons](https://v1.heroicons.com/) library. By following the steps below, you can easily include all icons in your projects:

<ol class="numeric-list u-margin-block-start-24">
  <li class="order-list-item">
    <div class="order-list-content">
      <div>
        <h4 class="u-bold">Navigate to Heroicons website</h4>
        <span>
          Navigate to [heroicons](https://v1.heroicons.com/) and make sure you
          are looking at the solid icons. Select an icon and copy its name.
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="order-list-item">
    <div class="order-list-content">
      <div>
        <h4 class="u-bold">Use the selected icon</h4>
        <span>
          In your code use a class, type `icon-` and paste the iconâ€™s name right
          after.
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

## Additional Icons

Social and technology icons are available in gray-scale and color. Gray-scale Icons were translated into class names and color icons are available as SVG files.

## Best Practice

We recommend using at minimum 4px of space between icons and labels for
legibility. Icons should be aligned to the center of a single line of text. If
there are multiple lines in a label, the icon should be aligned to the center
of the first line in the label.
