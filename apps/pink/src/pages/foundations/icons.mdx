In Appwrite we use [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) solid icons library. We
recommend the use of up to three icon sizes for consistency. In the Appwrite
console, for example, icons are either 24px, 20px (the default), or 16px. Icon
size should depend on the height of the label the icon is next to, or if it's
next to a label at all.<br /><br />

## Usage

<p class="u-margin-block-start-16">
  We recommend icons next to labels should have at minimum 4px of space in
  between for legibility. Icons should be aligned to the center of a single line
  of text. If there are multiple lines in a label should be aligned to the
  center of the first line in the label.
