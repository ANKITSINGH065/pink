title: Elevation
description: Elevation is the relative distance between two surfaces along the z-axis. Shadows and blurs create a layered effect that visually indicates that an object is "elevated" in priority or hierarchy.

## Types

In the Appwrite console we use two types of elevation:

| Class          | Type  |                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shadow-small` | Small | Use to show contrast between layout elements, such as cards or tables, to the surface.                        |
| `shadow-large` | Large | Use to show contrast between ‘floating’ components, such as popovers, alerts or modals, to the surface below. |

<Preview center>
  <div class="card" style="box-shadow:var(--shadow-small);">
    shadow-small
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="box-shadow:var(--shadow-large);">
    shadow-large
  </div>
</Preview>

## Usage

<div class="u-flex u-flex-vertical u-gap-32">
Small shadows should be used with standard layout components (e.g. cards, tables).

We recommend the use of a large drop-shadow for floating components (e.g. popovers, alerts, modals).

:::DO
To create contrast between a floating surface and the surface beneath, use shadow-large.
:::

:::DONT
Do not make floating elements look flat by not using shadows.
